<div class="entry-content"><p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In computer software, Easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the earliest examples was in the TOPS-10 operating system, first developed in 1964. The make command was used to invoke the TECO editor to create a file; so when given the argument &ldquo;accounting&rdquo;, the call would be &ldquo;make accounting&rdquo; to create a file called &ldquo;accounting&rdquo;. If given the file name argument &ldquo;love&rdquo;, so that the command was &ldquo;make love&rdquo;, it would pause and respond &ldquo;not war?&rdquo; before creating the file.</p>

<h2>Adventure</h2>

<p><img src="/images/112515/adventure.jpg" alt="Adventure" /></p>

<p>The actual term &ldquo;Easter Egg&rdquo; with regards to software was first used in 1979. Atari was the biggest publisher of video games in the world. It was common at the time for games to be completed programmed by a single developer, and he/she would not be credited anywhere on or in the game. Adventure, a game for the Atari 2600, went on to sell over a million copies, but its developer, Warren Robinett, was working on a salary of $22,000 a year. In a bid for recognition, Robinett inserted a hidden room in the game that contained the text &ldquo;Created by Warren Robinett&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="/images/112515/warren.gif" alt="Adventure" /></p>

<p>In James Hague&rsquo;s book Halcyon Days: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Games Programmers, Robinett explained:</p>

<blockquote><p>Each 2600 game was designed entirely by one person. But on the package it said basically &ldquo;Adventure, by Atari.&rdquo; And we were only getting salaries, no cut of the huge profits. It was a signature, like at the bottom of a painting. But to make it happen, I had to hide my signature in the code, in a really obscure place, and not tell anybody. Of course, an adventure game, with multiple rooms, is perfect for secret things, because it&rsquo;s easy to make extra rooms that are really hard to get into.</p></blockquote>

<p>When a kid eventually found the secret room and wrote to Atari, they referred to it as an &ldquo;Easter Egg&rdquo; in their response. Software companies have continued to put Easter Eggs in their products ever since. Some notable examples in early Microsoft products:</p>

<ul>
<li>Early versions of Windows and other MS products like Excel contained hidden credits for members of the production teams.</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel 95 contained a hidden Doom-like action game called The Hall of Tortured Souls.</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel 97 contained a hidden flight simulator.</li>
<li>Microsoft Access 97 had a simulation of the Magic 8-Ball fortune-telling toy.</li>
<li>Microsoft Word 97 contained a pinball game.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some more recent examples (Google is ripe with them, only a few documented here. Mozilla also has a few):</p>

<ul>
<li>On a Mac, in your terminal type &ldquo;emacs&rdquo;, then on the next screen hit Esc and X at the same time. Type in &ldquo;snake&rdquo;, &ldquo;pong&rdquo;, or &ldquo;tetris&rdquo; and see what happens! Also try &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; to boot up an old program called ELIZA that simulates a real conversation.</li>
<li>If you do a Google image search for &ldquo;Atari Breakout&rdquo;, the images will rearrange into blocks and you can play a version of the game.</li>
<li>Similarly, if you hold the left arrow key and then push up on any youtube video, a trail of connected blocks appear and you can play Snake (although this one seems like it may have been discontinued).</li>
<li>For a time, Google Maps contained several Easter eggs whereby a user asking for directions from Japan to China, from New York to Tokyo, or from Taiwan to China would be directed to either jetski, kayak, or swim across the Pacific Ocean. Also asking it for walking directions from the Shire to Mordor used to produce &ldquo;One does not simply walk into Mordor&rdquo;. Earls Court Road in London, shows a police box that allows the user to enter the TARDIS from Doctor Who.</li>
<li>Google search responds to &ldquo;Do A Barrel Roll&rdquo; in the search box by tilting the page 360Â°, as if a pilot were maneuvering an aircraft. This is a reference to the popular video game series Star Fox, where the phrase became famous.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are even some examples of Easter Eggs hidden in computer hardware:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 1993 AMI BIOS that on November 13, 1993, proceeded to play &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; via the PC speaker over and over again instead of booting</li>
<li>Several early Apple Macintosh models which had pictures of the development team hidden in the ROM (accessible by pressing the programmer&rsquo;s switch and jumping to a specific memory address, or other equally obscure means).</li>
</ul>
