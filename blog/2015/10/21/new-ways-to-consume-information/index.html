<div class="entry-content"><p>After using puts to no end, I was curious to see what interesting (and practical) ways there are out there to output and consume information in Ruby. Inspired by a project idea from Avi, I looked into Twilio, a company that &ldquo;allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls and send and receive text messages using its web service APIs&rdquo;. (Wikipedia)</p>

<p>After signing up for an account and trial phone number on their website, it was easy to find documentation for their different APIs. I don&rsquo;t think they could have made the Ruby one any simpler:</p>

<p><img src="../images/102015/twilio.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I divided this into 2 methods and wrapped a class around it so that I could pass the message through.</p>

<p><img src="../images/102015/twilio-2.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>I was kind of amazed to see it work right away.</p>

<p>After sending a few texts, however, I noticed I had begun incurring a charge on my Twilio account for each one.</p>

<p><img src="../images/102015/twilio3.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Paranoid that I was going to rack up a bill, forget about it, and end up with collections chasing after me for a few pennies, I reached out to Twilio support to figure out how I could pay the balance (there was no obvious way to do so on the website). While I was waiting for a response, I was pondering other possible delivery methods. What about email?</p>

<p>After some Googling, I found a quick and easy solution. Armed with a new Gmail account for testing, I took what I found and wrapped everything in a class with a send_mail method (this should probably be split up into more methods but I wanted to get it working):</p>

<p><img src="../images/102015/gmail.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Again, I was half surprised to see that it worked right away. Much to the dismay of several of our fellow students, I immediately began to spam some of them with email blasts containing various facts about sloths.</p>

<p>Shortly after implementing the mailer, Twilio&rsquo;s response came:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello korey,</p>

<p>Thank you for reaching out! With a trial account we give you about roughly $30 of real credit to test with, but we do not expose balance in the UI until you upgrade.</p>

<p>Looks like you have about $28.00 left or so, until you would need to upgrade. We will notify you when your balance is getting low.</p>

<p>I hope that this information is helpful. Let me know if you have further questions</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Twilio Customer Support</p></blockquote>

<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to worry about getting charged on a trial account until you hit about $30.</p>

<p>Well, there you have it. Two cool ways to send information in Ruby. I recommend playing around with both of these, as they are both easy to setup and will quickly open up a lot of real-life applications to many of the things we have been learning. Have fun!</p>
